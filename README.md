# Volk Raycasting Tech Demo

**This project is currently on haitus**

Volk is an HTML5 raycasting tech demo using pure JavaScript and canvas.

It is similar in style to Wolfenstein 3D's engine, with no height
variance but will support textures for walls and such.

The engine will be able to load map files (.volkmap extensions),
which are just plain text files which hold 2D array information.

Current version: v0.1.0-prealpha
