VolkJS Raycasting Engine
========================

Name is inspired by the word "Wolf" from Wolfenstein 3D translated to Russian,
which is "Volk" when Latinized. JS is for JavaScript.

VolkJS is an HTML5 raycasting engine for pure JavaScript and canvas.

It is similar in style to Wolfenstein 3D's engine, with no height
variance but does support textures for walls and such.

Maps are represented as arrays of arrays (2D arrays), with each element
being a number starting from 0, representing an object in the map.
Maps are 2D square grids.

0 = Empty space
1 - Whatever = Block/wall with certain color or texture

The engine will be able to load map files (.volkmap extensions).

** As of now, the engine will not act as an API, but rather a
raycasting tech demo. API support will be added in the future,
so that real games can be built using VolkJS. **
