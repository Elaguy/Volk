/*
	VolkJS - Basic HTML5 Canvas Raycasting Engine
	
	Written by Elaguy, starting 06/19/18
	
	In its current state, VolkJS cannot be used as an API,
	but instead acts as a raycasting tech demo.
	
	In the future, this source code will be modified to
	act as an API, allowing real games to be built using
	it.
	
	v0.0.0-prealpha
